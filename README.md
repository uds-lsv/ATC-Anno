# ATC-Anno

ATC-Anno is an annotation tool for the transcription and semantic annotation of air traffic control utterances.
Its most unusual feature is its prediction of semantic annotations based on a finite-state grammar. As long as a transcribed sentence is moderately close to a sentence in the grammar, the annotation found in the grammar can be applied to the transcription.

## Tutorial

To demonstrate the workflow and features of the tool, we have created a brief video tutorial.
The video has optional subtitles.

## Requirements

ATC-Anno is written in Python 3 and requires the following additional packages:

- [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org/)
- [pyaudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/)

### Finite-state Grammar

To access the **_Get XML_** feature, you need to provide a finite-state grammar that uses the [OpenFST](http://www.openfst.org/) format.
The default location for the grammar is `data/grammars/default.fst`

### Concept Extraction

The conversion of airline names to callsign representations (e.g. "Lufthansa" to "DLH") is based on the airline dictionary found at `data/airlines/callsigns.txt`. You can expand the file to include all airlines that occur in your grammar.
